    <p>Flinto prototype of ordering application for the popular Philadelphia food truck Schmear It. The prototype was informed by

    <p>The initial structure of the project underwent quite a lot change throughout the project. We spent a lot of time in this
    stage, to ensure that the process for ordering was as simple as possible. In this stage we created a paper prototype, and
    conducted usability tests to find the most base level flaws in our designs. Right off the bat we discovered flaws in our
    system, and worked to correct them before adding interactivity.
    </p>


 


    <p>Adding a bit of interactivity to our wireframes allowed us to begin our user tests early, and identify the flaws in basic
    structure before we begun implementing the design language at all. We realized quickly that Schmear It’s custom “build your
    own” option was going to require a lot of attention if we hoped to create a seamless experience. User’s had trouble building
    their own orders with our initial structure, and the accordian menus proved to be confusing. It was in this phase that was
    returned to the drawing board and simplified this structure, moving towards having all custom options listed in the same
    window. We had initially rejected this idea, believing that users would prefer to have the different order elements separated,
    but our tests revealed that we were wrong.
    </p>




    <div class="placeholder" id="low-fidelity">
        <img src="img/schmear/low.png" alt="">
    </div>


    <div class="placeholder" id="mid-fidelity">
    <img src="img/schmear/mid.png" alt="">
    </div>


    <p>Now it was time to begin adding some visual elements to the structure. Research revealed a slightly inconsistent branding
    history, and we worked with Schmear It to piece together the puzzle that was their brand identity. The slightly retro-designs
    or their logo and truck, were paired with a modern approach to color and layout to capture the brand the company had worked
    to cultivate. This underwent several more rounds of usability tests, which revealed problems with navigating the cart, and
    inconsistent design pattern.
    </p>

   


    <p>After correcting the issues discovered during Mid-fidelity user testing, we moved our attention to interactivity, specifically
    our micro-interactions. We identified many UI places within the existing UI where interaction could be made more seamless.
    We used animations to communicate to the users what was happening, and to explain without words how to the application worked.
    We tested our prototype again and found that the micro-interactions were helpful in guiding the user through the process.
