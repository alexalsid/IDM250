    <h1>Hi, I’m Alex.</h1>
   
<div id="bio">
    
     <p>I’m a designer, developer and student in Philadelphia, working to create cohesive, beautiful and above all seamless digital
    experiences. My passion for design found a home on the web, where I truly feel there are no limitations. For me, design and
    development are linked to one another, and it is imperative to understand one in order to appreciate the other.</p>
    
    <p>My greatest hope is work on projects which are larger than me, or even the team I work with, projects that hold a piece of truth, or
    joy, or beauty. I love my medium. It is without restraints, available to all who wish to experience it, and full of untapped
    potential. To me, development is an art. Let’s create something memorable together.</p>
